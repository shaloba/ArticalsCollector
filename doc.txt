This module using BeautifulSoup Module to extract the html tags data.
The module combine from Three main classes:
    1. FileDao- managing the article storage.

    Before running the script, activate the virtual environment:
        1. cd ~/ArticlesCollector
        2. source venv/bin/activate

    Examples:
        1. python articles_collector.py --collect

    1. To extract the site main links I used simple regex with the requests package.
       For more efficient and deeper scanning use Scrapy framework.
